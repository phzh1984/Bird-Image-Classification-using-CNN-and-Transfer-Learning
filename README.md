# Bird-Image-Classification-using-CNN-and-Transfer-Learning

Overview

Wildlife conservation has been transformed by the application of artificial intelligence (AI). This project focuses on bird classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and transfer learning. AI is not only used to understand wildlife behavior but also to protect and conserve species. Here are some key benefits of AI in wildlife conservation:

•	Collect vast datasets and analyze them quickly.

•	Study and protect animal species collectively.

•	Track wildlife patterns and predict the extinction of endangered species.

•	Detect and prevent wildlife poaching.

•	Assess the impact of climate change on wildlife.

•	Identify and classify animal species.

•	Conserve animal habitats by predicting migratory patterns.

Dataset Details

525 bird species.

84,635 training images.

2,625 test images (5 images per species).

2,625 validation images (5 images per species).

Clean dataset with no duplicate images.

High-quality images with a single bird per image.

Images cropped to ensure the bird occupies at least 50% of the pixels.

Images resized to 224x224 pixels.

Accompanied by a birds.csv file with image metadata.
